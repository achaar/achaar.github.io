But there are embedded systems which still run on 32 bit structure.\n\nMoreover many data structures in use today have 32-bit time representations embedded into their structure. A full list of these data structures is virtually impossible to derive but there are well-known data structures that have the Unix time problem:\n\n* file systems (many file systems use only 32 bits to represent times in inodes binary file formats (that use 32-bit time fields).\n\n* databases (that have 32-bit time fields)\n\n* database query languages, like SQL that have UNIX_TIMESTAMP() like commands.\n\nExamples of systems utilizing data structures that may contain 32-bit time representations include:\n\n* COBOL systems of 1970s–1990s vintage that have not been replaced by 2038-compliant systems[citation needed]\n\n* Embedded factory, refinery control and monitoring subsystems assorted medical devices assorted military devices\n\n* Any system making use of data structures containing 32-bit time representations will present risk. The degree of risk is dependent on the mode of failure.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe use following methods to tackle y2038 issue:\n\n* we can support both 32 bit and 64 bit compatible time_t values. We will let lib_c to decide which values needs to be chosen.\n\n* 32-bit systems using data structures like 'struct timeval', 'struct time_t' will break in the year 2038, so we have to replace that code with more appropriate types.\n\n## Contribution\n\nList of contribution towards this projects can be found [here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git/log/?h=staging-next&qt=author&q=somyaanand214%40gmail.com&showmsg=1)",
