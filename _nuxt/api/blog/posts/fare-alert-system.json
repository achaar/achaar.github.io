For instance, Airlines start actively increasing fares in the last 2 weeks, often doubling them 24hrs prior to departure time. Under competitive pressure from other airlines, they also announce flash sales with significantly reduced fares sometimes by even 50%. The catch however is, limited seat availability at such discounted fares. This dynamism in fares fluctuating up and down often during the same day, is bound to drive travellers anxious about fares. As a result, a potential customer often search multiple times inorder to find the best pricing for the route.

Instead of having just minimum, maximum and median airfare to represent three classes of fare distribution in fare calendar,\nwe can design a smart airfare categorization using clustering algorithms.",
