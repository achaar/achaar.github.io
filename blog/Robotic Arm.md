# Robotic Arm

Designed and made a Robotic arm in my Sophomore Year with my friends, Ayush and Rahul. The design was made on Google SketchUp. The robot for made for a competition in Inter Hostel Technical Festival of IITG, Kriti. The bot was needed to clamp objects in an arena and then drop them in bins. Ayush and I, worked on the robot's hardware and construction, while Rahul helped us code the equations on the Arduino environment. We calculated the maximum torque at each joint, so that the robot could be optimally designed. We used an Arduino board for programming the Servo motors and the commands for movement were sent from the laptop through a USB connection. I solved for the equations for the compound movements, i.e., left key would move the bot by how much at each joint. This helped us write exact equations for each servo. Ayush worked on the clamp and Rahul came up with the solution for avoinding an Enter key after every command so that the bot was easy to use. The bot worked really well and was the best designed bot at the competition. But, we still got kicked out. And that's a story for another day!
